# Brute-force-KNN

This notebook shows the complete implementation of the distance based K Nearest Neighbors algorithm. Following are the modules found within:-
1. Two distance metrics (Euclidean and Manhattan)
2. The algorithm brute-force K-NN algorithm without the use of external libraries like sklearn.
3. Cross-validation function for hyperparameter selection.
4. Outlier analysis.
5. Feature scaling to the dataset.
6. Feature selection
7. Model evaluation

The entire notebook is divided into 3 primary parts:-
Part A : Model Code
This part consists of the functions and classes required to execute on.
Part B : Data Processing
This part consists of everything from data cleaning to outlier analysis.
Part C : Model Evaluation
This part consists of the results of the brute force approach of KNN, of course with hyperparameters being finalised with cross-validation.

The dataset used here is https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality.
